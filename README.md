# Question: How do you implement a simple version of regular expression matching with `.` and `*`? C# Summary

The provided C# code is a simple console application that implements a basic version of regular expression matching using the characters `.` and `*`. The `IsMatch` function is the core of this application, which takes two strings as input: the text to be matched and the pattern to match against. The `.` character in the pattern matches any single character in the text, while the `*` character matches zero or more of the preceding element. The function first checks if the pattern is empty, and if so, returns whether the text is also empty. Then, it checks if the first character of the text matches the first character of the pattern or if the first character of the pattern is a `.`. If the pattern has a length of at least 2 and the second character is a `*`, the function recursively checks if the rest of the text matches the rest of the pattern after the `*`, or if the first character matches and the rest of the text matches the pattern. If the second character of the pattern is not a `*`, the function recursively checks if the first character matches and the rest of the text matches the rest of the pattern. This recursive approach allows the function to handle patterns of any length and complexity.

# Python Differences

The Python and C# versions of the solution are very similar in terms of logic and structure. Both use recursion to solve the problem and have similar control flow. However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax of Python and C#.

1. User Input: In the Python version, the user is asked to input the text and pattern, while in the C# version, the text and pattern are hardcoded.

2. String Manipulation: In the C# version, the `Substring` method is used to get the rest of the string from a certain index. In Python, string slicing is used, which is a built-in feature of the language.

3. Checking if a String is Empty: In C#, `string.IsNullOrEmpty` method is used to check if a string is empty or null. In Python, `not text` is used to check if a string is empty.

4. Checking if the First Character Matches: In C#, the `==` operator is used to check if the first character of the pattern is the same as the first character of the text or if it is a `.`. In Python, the `in` operator is used with a set containing the first character of the text and `.`.

5. Boolean Conversion: In Python, the `bool` function is used to convert the result of the `and` operation to a boolean. In C#, the result of the `&&` operation is already a boolean, so no conversion is needed.

6. Main Function: In Python, the `main` function is defined and then called in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This is a common pattern in Python to ensure that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module. In C#, the `Main` method is the entry point of the program and is automatically called when the program is run.

# Java Differences

The Java and C# versions of the solution are very similar in their approach to solving the problem. Both use recursion to check each character of the text against the pattern. The `.` character matches any single character, and the `*` character matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Input Method: In the C# version, the test cases are hard-coded into the `Main` method. In the Java version, the program takes input from the user through the console using a `Scanner` object.

2. String Manipulation: In C#, the `string` class has a `Length` property and an indexer to access individual characters. In Java, the `String` class has a `length()` method and a `charAt(int index)` method to access individual characters. Also, to check if a string is empty or null, C# uses `string.IsNullOrEmpty(string)`, while Java uses `string.isEmpty()`.

3. Method Declaration: In C#, methods are declared as `static` inside a class. In Java, methods can be declared as `public static`.

4. Console Output: In C#, `Console.WriteLine()` is used to print to the console. In Java, `System.out.println()` is used.

5. Naming Conventions: C# uses PascalCase for method names and local variables, while Java uses camelCase.

Overall, the logic of the solution is the same in both languages, but the syntax and some language-specific features differ.
